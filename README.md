These are my solutions for the Spring 2025 version of the course CS224S-Spoken Language Processing (Speech AI/ML).

1. Homework 1 - Audio processing. Completed
2. Homework 2 - TTS. Completed except for the simplistic part of generating voice samples from Bark 
3. Homework 3 - CTC algorithm (Warm-up notebook) + Building  Wav2vec (Main notebook). Completed
4. Homework 4 - creating & analysing t-SNE embeddings for multiple low-resource languages. Getting a baseline WER OF 56% using the HF Transformers library
5. Final project - reducing WER on low-resource language(isiZulu - a Sub-Saharan language). Have reduced WER on testing dataset from 55% from 38%.
   WIP to bring it down to sub-30%

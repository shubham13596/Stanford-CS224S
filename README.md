These are my solutions for the Spring 2025 version of the course CS224S-Spoken Language Processing (Speech AI/ML).

1. Homework 1 - Completed
   Audio processing
3. Homework 2 - Completed except for the simplistic part of generating voice samples from Bark 
   Covers TTS
4. Homework 3 - Completed
   CTC algorithm (Warm-up notebook) + Building  Wav2vec (Main notebook). Completed
5. Homework 4 - Completed
   creating & analysing t-SNE embeddings for multiple low-resource languages. Getting a baseline WER OF 56% using the HF Transformers library
6. Final project - Reduced WER from 56% to 38%. WIP to bring it down to sub-30%
   Reducing WER on low-resource language(isiZulu - a Sub-Saharan language) using only Fleurs dataset and a fine-tuned Wav2vec2 checkpoint
